I am interested in developing intelligent robots that can carry out complex tasks in the physical world with the same ease as humans. Such a robot must be able to perceive its environment, interact with it and learn from experience. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. In particular, I am interested in RL.
