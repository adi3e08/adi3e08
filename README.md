I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotics with a Computer Science concentration at Northeastern University. I am interested in robot learning, i. e, endowing robots with the ability to learn to carry out complex tasks in the physical world. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. In particular, I am interested in RL. Currently, I work on representation learning for RL.
