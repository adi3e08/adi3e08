Hi, I'm Adithya Ramesh. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Engineering Design from IIT Madras, India in 2016. 
I'm interested in deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL), in particular, their application to robotics. You can find more details on my [website](https://adi3e08.github.io/).
